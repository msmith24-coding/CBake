# CBake Development Information

## Styling Guide
- The CBake project does not use `using namespace std`.
- Functions have their `{}` on the next line.
- If statements have their `{}` on the same line. 
- While/For loops have their `{}` on the same line.
- Comments for functions should have the following format:
```C++
// +
// | This is an example function.
// +
void myFunction()
{

}
```
- Comments for if statements should have the following format:
```C++
if(true) { /* This will always be true. */

}
```
- Comments for while/for loops should have the following format:
```C++
while(true) { /* This loop will never end. */

}
```
